# Nirm UI automation framework
## The purpose of developing
The general idea of Testing Framework developing is provide the Company with scalability and extensibility testing platform for long-time use.

The scalability means (in this context) that new tests for existing application structure can be added to the test suite at any time with no low-level developing (coding on the WebDriver or WebElements level) or with just minimum developing of such type.

The extensibility means (in this context) that the Framework can be easily extended along with application development progress, based on using common architectural principles, common framework classes and pre-configured class templates.
